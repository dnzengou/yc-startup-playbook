ME IN A NUTSHELL

A mixed culture through my Rwandan, Central African origins and a Belgian citizenship,

I am an engineer technologist and nuclear physicist living in Sweden and serving clients all around Europe with the main one based In Czech Republic. System thinker with a consistent critical approach, versatility is a clearly demonstrated skill of mine combined with a deep interest in ‚Äì but not limited to ‚Äì Data Analytics, Innovation, AI, Blockain, eXtended Reality - XR (AR / VR), Capacity Building, Diversity in Tech and Inclusion.
If you are looking for a versatile, cross-functional and cross-cultural professional, someone who can talk tech, budget and innovation with a can-do attitude; I am that one.

If instead, you‚Äôd rather settle for a risk-averse, predictable linear alternatvie, I would be glad to recommend someelse ‚ò∫


Countries I have lived and/or worked in include Italy, Belgium, Portugal (A√ßores), Greece, Sweden, France, Canada, USA, Central African Republic, Rwanda, Benin. Organizations I have worked with include some of the Fortune 500, such as Google and Caterpillar, as well as public organizations like the EUSPA - European Agency for the Space Programme - and Government of Rwanda . I also worked for innovative fast pace public organizations and government. My previous managers can vouch for my outstanding achievements

Eager learner of Complexity Theory and adaptive systems simulations, I enjoy diving into the core of things, solve problems with a mix of methodologies learned amaths and programming (mostly in Matlab, python or C++) to simulate complex adaptive systems ‚Äì such as the climate, ecosystems, the society, startup organizations etc. in order to drive data-backed decision making.



If you work on the following üëáüèæ I can help!

Innovation, machine learning powered web apps, systems modeling, keynote public speaking, innovation enabling activiites (incubation/acceleration, capacity building workshop, fundraising and resources mobilization, pitch coaching, business and technology development, analytics, web3 and generative AI prototyping & more.

What drives me? Challenging projects, opportunities of learning, travels, nature. And fun things üåà ;-)
